Coaches and Guides:

Business coaches, life coaches, fitness trainers

You already know how to guide transformation.  
But sharing it can feel forced.  

Not because you lack insight.  
Because every coach is different.  
And your voice shouldn’t sound like anyone else’s.  

Consystnt listens first.  
It learns the way you speak, the way you teach,  
and the way your clients experience growth.  

Then it turns that into prompts  
that feel as natural as conversation.  

No scripts.  
No templates.  
Just you — made visible.

It learns the way you talk about your work,  
your customers, your neighborhood.

No templates.  
Just you — made visible.

habits, balance, and change.

Educators & Experts
Course creators, tutors, thought leaders

But sharing online can feel reductive.

how you break things down,  
how you make complex subjects clear.

that showcase your expertise  
without losing your voice.  

No dumbing down.  
No templates.  
Just you — made visible.
